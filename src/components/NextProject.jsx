          In my daily activities, I always listen to music through Spotify.
          Being one of my most used web applications, I have an interest in
          challenging myself to recreate the Spotify Web Player and also delve
          into full-stack development. {" "}
          <span className="hidden sm:inline">
            I have ideas of having my own twist to this application such as
            picking a random song to play, having some Spotify trivia, or adding
            friends on the platform. This will be impactful for my growth and
            another stepping stone in my journey as a software developer.
