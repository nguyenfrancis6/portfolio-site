          In my daily activities, I always listen to music through Spotify.
          Being one of my most used web applications, the interest in music led me to
          challenging myself to create a Spotify Guessing Game and also delve
          into full-stack development.{" "}
          <span className="hidden sm:inline">
            The idea is to have the user pick a genre to guess from and have a
            snippet of a song from that genre play. It will be similar to Wordle
            but it will be for music instead. This will be impactful for my
            growth and another stepping stone in my journey as a software
            developer.
